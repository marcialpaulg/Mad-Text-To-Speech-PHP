# Mad Text-To-Speech PHP
Mad TTS is a Text-To-Speech PHP class using Google TTS API without keys.

# Bug or Feature?
I discovered that Google TTS in translate.google.com doesn't use keys and uses cookie instead. By not passing a cookie, Google will respond a successful request with new cookie and MP3 data.
